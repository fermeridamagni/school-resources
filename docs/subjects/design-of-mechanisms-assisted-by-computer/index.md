# Design of Mechanisms Assisted by Computer

This directory contains practices and materials for the Computer-Aided Mechanism Design course.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the design and analysis of mechanical systems using computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Topics include:

- Mechanism kinematics
- Dynamic analysis
- Computer-aided engineering
- 3D modeling and simulation

## Practices

Each practice directory contains:

- CAD design files
- Preview images/diagrams
- Practice-specific documentation
