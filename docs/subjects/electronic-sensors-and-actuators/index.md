# Electronic Sensors and Actuators

This directory contains practices and materials for the Electronic Sensors and Actuators course.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the use of electronic sensors and actuators in embedded systems. Topics include:

- Ultrasonic sensors
- Digital and analog sensor interfacing
- Actuator control (LEDs, buzzers, relays)
- Arduino programming
- Real-time monitoring systems

## Practices

Each practice directory contains:

- Arduino source code (`.ino` files)
- Practice-specific README with details and objectives
- Supporting documentation

### Available Practices

- **practice-1**: Object counter using ultrasonic sensor
- **practice-1.1**: Water level monitoring system

## Development Environment

Projects in this subject typically use:

- **Arduino IDE**: Primary development environment
- **Arduino libraries**: Including Ultrasonic sensor library
- **Serial Monitor**: For debugging and monitoring sensor readings

## Getting Started

1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries (Ultrasonic.h)
3. Open the practice `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
4. Select the appropriate board and port
5. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board

## Hardware Requirements

Common components used across practices:

- Arduino board (Uno, Nano, or compatible)
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
- LEDs and resistors
- Buzzers
- Breadboard and jumper wires
