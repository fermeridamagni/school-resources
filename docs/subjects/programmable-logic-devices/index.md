# Programmable Logic Devices

This directory contains practices and materials for the Programmable Logic Devices course.

## Course Overview

Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are fundamental components in digital electronics. This course covers:

- PIC microcontroller programming
- Embedded systems development
- Hardware interfacing
- Digital logic implementation

## Practices

Each practice directory contains:

- Source code (`.c` files)
- MPLAB X IDE project files
- CMake build configuration
- Practice-specific README with structure information

### Available Practices

- Practice 2 — PIC16F887 Analog I/O: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-2-pic16f887-analog-io/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-2-pic16f887-analog-io/)
- Practice 3 — ESP32 House Alarm: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-3-esp32-house-alarm/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-3-esp32-house-alarm/)
- Practice 4 — Arduino Buzzers: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-4-arduino-and-buzzers/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-4-arduino-and-buzzers/)
- Practice 5 — Arduino IR Sensor: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-5-arduino-ir-sensor/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-5-arduino-ir-sensor/)
- Practice 6 — Arduino Traffic Light: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-6-arduino-traffic-light/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-6-arduino-traffic-light/)
- Practice 7 — Arduino LED Intermitence: [/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-7-arduino-led-intermitence/](/subjects/programmable-logic-devices/practices/practice-7-arduino-led-intermitence/)

## Development Environment

These projects are designed to work with:

- **MPLAB X IDE**: Primary development environment
- **XC8 Compiler**: C compiler for PIC microcontrollers
- **CMake**: Alternative build system support
- **Visual Studio Code**: Optional code editor with project integration

## Building Projects

Each practice can be built using:

1. MPLAB X IDE (recommended)
2. CMake build system (see cmake directory in each practice)

Refer to individual practice README files for specific build instructions.
