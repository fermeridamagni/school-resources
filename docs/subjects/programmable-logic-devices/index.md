# Programmable Logic Devices

This directory contains practices and materials for the Programmable Logic Devices course.

## Course Overview

Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are fundamental components in digital electronics. This course covers:

- PIC microcontroller programming
- Embedded systems development
- Hardware interfacing
- Digital logic implementation

## Practices

Each practice directory contains:

- Source code (`.c` files)
- MPLAB X IDE project files
- CMake build configuration
- Practice-specific README with structure information

### Available Practices

- **practice-1**: Introduction to PIC microcontrollers
- **practice-3**: Intermediate PIC programming concepts
- **practice-4**: Advanced PIC applications

## Development Environment

These projects are designed to work with:

- **MPLAB X IDE**: Primary development environment
- **XC8 Compiler**: C compiler for PIC microcontrollers
- **CMake**: Alternative build system support
- **Visual Studio Code**: Optional code editor with project integration

## Building Projects

Each practice can be built using:

1. MPLAB X IDE (recommended)
2. CMake build system (see cmake directory in each practice)

Refer to individual practice README files for specific build instructions.
